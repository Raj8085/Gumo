                <AccordionContent className="text-gray-300">
                On Gumo, handling bookings is a streamlined process. Customers are provided with the option to reserve a stay at a host&apos;s property for specific dates. After selecting the desired dates and specifying the number of guests, customers can proceed by clicking the &quot;Reserve now&quot; tab. Subsequently, the host is notified and has 24 hours to either accept, decline, or respond to the request. If the host accepts the reservation, it&apos;s promptly booked and confirmed. In case of a decline, hosts have the option to provide a reason, and any payment made by the customer is promptly refunded. Stay tuned for updates on API integration with your channel managers for seamless partnership management.
