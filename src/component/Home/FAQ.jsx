                  How do i monetize my content and how much can I earn?

                <AccordionContent className="text-gray-300">
                  You can monetize your content on Gumo by transforming your
                  travel experiences into bookable videos for your followers.
                  This not only enhances collaboration opportunities with
                  properties and resorts but also directly attributes bookings
                  to their properties, potentially increasing revenue for
                  sponsored content. You can earn up to 7.5% commission on
                  bookings of stays, with earnings potential varying based on
                  the type of stay and the property&apos;s partnership with
                  Gumo. Additionally, you can generate income on Gumo by listing
                  your own itineraries or travel packages.
